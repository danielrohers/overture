## About
Overture is a proxy crawler capable of read multiple free proxy list websites and test the results to leave only the healthy ones.

## Install
> npm install overturejs

## Usage
```javascript
const Overture = require('overture');

let overture = new Overture();
overture.start(interval(millis), callback);
// starts an Overture instance that verifies the proxy lists within the interval and returns the first list received in the callback
overture.list();
// shows the current proxy list in the console, and also returns it as an array
overture.healthCheck(newGateways, done);
// checks the healthy of the current proxy list, and also adds new optional proxies if correctly provided. When done, a list with the healthy proxies is returned.
overture.findHealthyGateway(index, callback);
// returns a tested healthy proxy server. You can also choose a specific one from the list() method passing its index.
overture.stop();
// stops the Overture instance
```
